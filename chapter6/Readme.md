# Chapter 6

First, install the code for chapter 6, open the project and run it. It will fail because of a missing jquery validation package. Click on tools->NuGet package manager->Package manager console. The console will open at the bottom of the window with a white bar across the top. On the right side of the bar is a button 'restore'. Click this, and eventually the project will recompile and open in your browser. My browser had serious lag from the Visual Studio launch to actually show the page.

MVC is:
- Model: The data and logic, like products for sale.
- View: What shows up in the web browser and how it is displayed.
- Controller: Handles converting the model into a view and sending info from the view back to the model.

There's a pretty [good explanation here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCvZtjoRq1I).

You don't need to know a lot about lambda expressions for this chapter, but here is [my explanation](lambda.md).

Read through the chapter and do the "Try It Out" exercise on starting at the bottom of page 180.
